    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION by William Archer
    </h2>
    <p>
      With <i>The Master Builder</i>&mdash;or <i>Master Builder Solness</i>, as
      the title runs in the original&mdash;we enter upon the final stage in
      Ibsen's career. "You are essentially right," the poet wrote to Count
      Prozor in March 1900, "when you say that the series which closes with the
      Epilogue (<i>When We Dead Awaken</i>) began with <i>Master Builder Solness</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ibsen," says Dr. Brahm, "wrote in Christiania all the four works which he
      thus seems to bracket together&mdash;<i>Solness</i>, <i>Eyolf</i>, <i>Borkman</i>,
      and <i>When We Dead Awaken</i>. He returned to Norway in July 1891, for a
      stay of indefinite length; but the restless wanderer over Europe was
      destined to leave his home no more.... He had not returned, however, to
      throw himself, as of old, into the battle of the passing day. Polemics are
      entirely absent from the poetry of his old age. He leaves the State and
      Society at peace. He who had departed as the creator of Falk [in <i>Love's
      Comedy</i>] now, on his return, gazes into the secret places of human
      nature and the wonder of his own soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Brahm, however, seems to be mistaken in thinking that Ibsen returned
      to Norway with no definite intention of settling down. Dr. Julius Elias
      (an excellent authority) reports that shortly before Ibsen left Munich in
      1891, he remarked one day, "I must get back to the North!" "Is that a
      sudden impulse?" asked Elias. "Oh no," was the reply; "I want to be a good
      head of a household and have my affairs in order. To that end I must
      consolidate may property, lay it down in good securities, and get it under
      control&mdash;and that one can best do where one has rights of
      citizenship." Some critics will no doubt be shocked to find the poet whom
      they have written down an "anarchist" confessing such bourgeois motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his return to Norway, Ibsen's correspondence became very scant, and
      we have no letters dating from the period when he was at work on <i>The
      Master Builder</i>. On the other hand, we possess a curious lyrical
      prelude to the play, which he put on paper on March 16, 1892. It is said
      to have been his habit, before setting to work on a play, to "crystallise
      in a poem the mood which then possessed him;" but the following is the
      only one of these keynote poems which has been published. I give it in the
      original language, with a literal translation:
    </p>
    <p>
      DE SAD DER, DE TO&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     De sad der, de to, i saa lunt et hus
     ved host og i venterdage,
     Saa braendte huset.  Alt ligger i grus.
     De to faar i asken rage.

     For nede id en er et smykke gemt,&mdash;
     et smykke, som aldrig kan braende.
     Og leder de trofast, haender det nemt
     at det findes af ham eller hende.

     Men finder de end, brandlidte to,
     det dyre, ildfaste smykke,&mdash;
     aldrig han finder sin braendte tro,
     han aldrig sin braendte lykke.
</pre>
    <p>
      THEY SAT THERE, THE TWO&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  They sat there, the two, in so cosy a house, through autumn
  and winter days.  Then the house burned down.  Everything
  lies in ruins.  The two must grope among the ashes.

  For among them is hidden a jewel&mdash;a jewel that never can burn.
  And if they search faithfully, it may easily happen that he
  or she may find it.

  But even should they find it, the burnt-out two&mdash;find this
  precious unburnable jewel&mdash;never will she find her burnt faith,
  he never his burnt happiness.
</pre>
    <p>
      This is the latest piece of Ibsen's verse that has been given to the
      world; but one of his earliest poems&mdash;first printed in 1858&mdash;was
      also, in some sort, a prelude to <i>The Master Builder</i>. Of this a
      literal translation may suffice. It is called,
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDING-PLANS
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I remember as clearly as if it had been to-day the evening
  when, in the paper, I saw my first poem in print.  There I
  sat in my den, and, with long-drawn puffs, I smoked and I
  dreamed in blissful self-complacency.

  "I will build a cloud-castle.  It shall shine all over the
  North.  It shall have two wings: one little and one great.
  The great wing shall shelter a deathless poet; the little
  wing shall serve as a young girl's bower."

  The plan seemed to me nobly harmonious; but as time went on
  it fell into confusion.  When the master grew reasonable, the
  castle turned utterly crazy; the great wing became too little,
  the little wing fell to ruin.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus we see that, thirty-five years before the date of <i>The Master
      Builder</i>, Ibsen's imagination was preoccupied with a symbol of a master
      building a castle in the air, and a young girl in one of its towers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There has been some competition among the poet's young lady friends for
      the honour of having served as his model for Hilda. Several, no doubt, are
      entitled to some share in it. One is not surprised to learn that among the
      papers he left behind were sheaves upon sheaves of letters from women.
      "All these ladies," says Dr. Julius Elias, "demanded something of him&mdash;some
      cure for their agonies of soul, or for the incomprehension from which they
      suffered; some solution of the riddle of their nature. Almost every one of
      them regarded herself as a problem to which Ibsen could not but have the
      time and the interest to apply himself. They all thought they had a claim
      on the creator of Nora.... Of this chapter of his experience, Fru Ibsen
      spoke with ironic humour. 'Ibsen (I have often said to him), Ibsen, keep
      these swarms of over-strained womenfolk at arm's length.' 'Oh no (he would
      reply), let them alone. I want to observe them more closely.' His
      observations would take a longer or shorter time as the case might be, and
      would always contribute to some work of art."
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal model for Hilda was doubtless Fraulein Emilie Bardach, of
      Vienna, whom he met at Gossensass in the autumn of 1889. He was then
      sixty-one years of age; she is said to have been seventeen. As the lady
      herself handed his letters to Dr. Brandes for publication, there can be no
      indiscretion in speaking of them freely. Some passages from them I have
      quoted in the introduction to <i>Hedda Gabler</i>&mdash;passages which
      show that at first the poet deliberately put aside his Gossensass
      impressions for use when he should stand at a greater distance from them,
      and meanwhile devoted himself to work in a totally different key. On
      October 15, 1889, he writes, in his second letter to Fraulein Bardach: "I
      cannot repress my summer memories, nor do I want to. I live through my
      experiences again and again. To transmute it all into a poem I find, in
      the meantime, impossible. In the meantime? Shall I succeed in doing so
      some time in the future? And do I really wish to succeed? In the meantime,
      at any rate, I do not.... And yet it must come in time." The letters
      number twelve in all, and are couched in a tone of sentimental regret for
      the brief, bright summer days of their acquaintanceship. The keynote is
      struck in the inscription on the back of a photograph which he gave her
      before they parted: <i>An die Maisonne eines Septemberlebens&mdash;in
      Tirol</i>,(1) 27/9/89. In her album he had written the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Hohes, schmerzliches Gluck&mdash;
     um das Unerreichbare zu ringen!(2)
</pre>
    <p>
      in which we may, if we like, see a foreshadowing of the Solness frame of
      mind. In the fifth letter of the series he refers to her as "an enigmatic
      Princess"; in the sixth he twice calls her "my dear Princess"; but this is
      the only point at which the letters quite definitely and unmistakably
      point forward to <i>The Master Builder</i>. In the ninth letter (February
      6, 1890) he says: "I feel it a matter of conscience to end, or at any
      rate, to restrict, our correspondence." The tenth letter, six months
      later, is one of kindly condolence on the death of the young lady's
      father. In the eleventh (very short) note, dated December 30, 1890, he
      acknowledges some small gift, but says: "Please, for the present, do not
      write me again.... I will soon send you my new play [<i>Hedda Gabler</i>].
      Receive it in friendship, but in silence!" This injunction she apparently
      obeyed. When <i>The Master Builder</i> appeared, it would seem that Ibsen
      did not even send her a copy of the play; and we gather that he was rather
      annoyed when she sent him a photograph signed "Princess of Orangia." On
      his seventieth birthday, however, she telegraphed her congratulations, to
      which he returned a very cordial reply. And here their relations ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she was right, however, in regarding herself as his principal model
      for Hilda appears from an anecdote related by Dr. Elias.(3) It is not an
      altogether pleasing anecdote, but Dr. Elias is an unexceptionable witness,
      and it can by no means be omitted from an examination into the origins of
      <i>The Master Builder</i>. Ibsen had come to Berlin in February 1891 for
      the first performance of <i>Hedda Gabler</i>. Such experiences were always
      a trial to him, and he felt greatly relieved when they were over. Packing,
      too, he detested; and Elias having helped him through this terrible
      ordeal, the two sat down to lunch together, while awaiting the train. An
      expansive mood descended upon Ibsen, and chuckling over his champagne
      glass, he said: "Do you know, my next play is already hovering before me&mdash;of
      course in vague outline. But of one thing I have got firm hold. An
      experience: a woman's figure. Very interesting, very interesting indeed.
      Again a spice of the devilry in it." Then he related how he had met in the
      Tyrol a Viennese girl of very remarkable character. She had at once made
      him her confidant. The gist of her confessions was that she did not care a
      bit about one day marrying a well brought-up young man&mdash;most likely
      she would never marry. What tempted and charmed and delighted her was to
      lure other women's husbands away from them. She was a little daemonic
      wrecker; she often appeared to him like a little bird of prey, that would
      fain have made him, too, her booty. He had studied her very, very closely.
      For the rest, she had had no great success with him. "She did not get hold
      of me, but I got hold of her&mdash;for my play. Then I fancy" (here he
      chuckled again) "she consoled herself with some one else." Love seemed to
      mean for her only a sort of morbid imagination. This, however, was only
      one side of her nature. His little model had had a great deal of heart and
      of womanly understanding; and thanks to the spontaneous power she could
      gain over him, every woman might, if she wished it, guide some man towards
      the good. "Thus Ibsen spoke," says Elias, "calmly and coolly, gazing as it
      were into the far distance, like an artist taking an objective view of
      some experience&mdash;like Lubek speaking of his soul-thefts. He had
      stolen a soul, and put it to a double employment. Thea Elvsted and Hilda
      Wangel are intimately related&mdash;are, indeed only different expressions
      of the same nature." If Ibsen actually declared Thea and Hilda to be drawn
      from one model, we must of course take his word for it; but the
      relationship is hard to discern.
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be no reasonable doubt, then, that the Gossensass episode gave
      the primary impulse to <i>The Master Builder</i>. But it seems pretty well
      established, too, that another lady, whom he met in Christiania after his
      return in 1891, also contributed largely to the character of Hilda. This
      may have been the reason why he resented Fraulein Bardach's appropriating
      to herself the title of "Princess of Orangia."
    </p>
    <p>
      The play was published in the middle of December 1892. It was acted both
      in Germany and England before it was seen in the Scandinavian capitals.
      Its first performance took place at the Lessing Theatre, Berlin, January
      19, 1893, with Emanuel Reicher as Solness and Frl. Reisenhofer as Hilda.
      In London it was first performed at the Trafalgar Square Theatre (now the
      Duke of York's) on February 20, 1893, under the direction of Mr. Herbert
      Waring and Miss Elizabeth Robins, who played Solness and Hilda. This was
      one of the most brilliant and successful of English Ibsen productions.
      Miss Robins was almost an ideal Hilda, and Mr. Waring's Solness was
      exceedingly able. Some thirty performances were give in all, and the play
      was reproduced at the Opera Comique later in the season, with Mr. Lewis
      Waller as Solness. In the following year Miss Robins acted Hilda in
      Manchester. In Christiania and Copenhagen the play was produced on the
      same evening, March 8, 1893; the Copenhagen Solness and Hilda were Emil
      Poulsen and Fru Hennings. A Swedish production, by Lindberg, soon
      followed, both in Stockholm and Gothenburg. In Paris <i>Solness le
      constructeur</i> was not seen until April 3, 1894, when it was produced by
      "L'OEuvre" with M. Lugne-Poe as Solness. The company, sometimes with Mme.
      Suzanne Despres and sometimes with Mme. Berthe Bady as Hilda, in 1894 and
      1895 presented the play in London, Brussels, Amsterdam, Milan, and other
      cities. In October 1894 they visited Christiania, where Ibsen was present
      at one of their performances, and is reported by Herman Bang to have been
      so enraptured with it that he exclaimed, "This is the resurrection of my
      play!" On this occasion Mme. Bady was the Hilda. The first performance of
      the play in America took place at the Carnegie Lyceum, New York, on
      January 16, 1900, with Mr. William H. Pascoe as Solness and Miss Florence
      Kahn as Hilda. The performance was repeated in the course of the same
      month, both at Washington and Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      In England, and probably elsewhere as well, <i>The Master Builder</i>
      produced a curious double effect. It alienated many of the poet's
      staunchest admirers, and it powerfully attracted many people who had
      hitherto been hostile to him. Looking back, it is easy to see why this
      should have been so; for here was certainly a new thing in drama, which
      could not but set up many novel reactions. A greater contrast could
      scarcely be imagined than that between the hard, cold, precise outlines of
      <i>Hedda Gabler</i> and the vague mysterious atmosphere of <i>The Master
      Builder</i>, in which, though the dialogue is sternly restrained within
      the limits of prose, the art of drama seems for ever on the point of
      floating away to blend with the art of music. Substantially, the play is
      one long dialogue between Solness and Hilda; and it would be quite
      possible to analyse this dialogue in terms of music, noting (for example)
      the announcement first of this theme and then of that, the resumption and
      reinforcement of a theme which seemed to have been dropped, the
      contrapuntal interweaving of two or more motives, a scherzo here, a fugal
      passage there. Leaving this exercise to some one more skilled in music (or
      less unskilled) than myself, I may note that in <i>The Master Builder</i>
      Ibsen resumes his favourite retrospective method, from which in <i>Hedda
      Gabler</i> he had in great measure departed. But the retrospect with which
      we are here concerned is purely psychological. The external events
      involved in it are few and simple in comparison with the external events
      which are successively unveiled in retrospective passages of <i>The Wild
      Duck</i> or <i>Rosmersholm</i>. The matter of the play is the soul-history
      of Halvard Solness, recounted to an impassioned listener&mdash;so
      impassioned, indeed, that the soul-changes it begets in her form an
      absorbing and thrilling drama. The graduations, retardations,
      accelerations of Solness's self-revealment are managed with the subtlest
      art, so as to keep the interest of the spectator ever on the stretch. The
      technical method was not new; it was simply that which Ibsen had been
      perfecting from <i>Pillars of Society</i> onward; but it was applied to a
      subject of a nature not only new to him, but new to literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the play is full of symbolism it would be futile to deny; and the
      symbolism is mainly autobiographic. The churches which Solness sets out
      building doubtless represent Ibsen's early romantic plays, the "homes for
      human beings" his social drama; while the houses with high towers, merging
      into "castles in the air," stand for those spiritual dramas, with a wide
      outlook over the metaphysical environment of humanity, on which he was
      henceforth to be engaged. Perhaps it is not altogether fanciful to read a
      personal reference into Solness's refusal to call himself an architect, on
      the ground that his training has not been systematic&mdash;that he is a
      self-taught man. Ibsen too was in all essentials self-taught; his
      philosophy was entirely unsystematic; and, like Solness, he was no student
      of books. There may be an introspective note also in that dread of the
      younger generation to which Solness confesses. It is certain that the old
      Master-Builder was not lavish of his certificates of competence to young
      aspirants, though there is nothing to show that his reticence ever
      depressed or quenched any rising genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, then, it cannot be doubted that several symbolic motives are
      inwoven into the iridescent fabric of the play. But it is a great mistake
      to regard it as essentially and inseparably a piece of symbolism.
      Essentially it is a history of a sickly conscience, worked out in terms of
      pure psychology. Or rather, it is a study of a sickly and a robust
      conscience side by side. "The conscience is very conservative," Ibsen has
      somewhere said; and here Solness's conservatism is contrasted with Hilda's
      radicalism&mdash;or rather would-be radicalism, for we are led to suspect,
      towards the close, that the radical too is a conservative in spite or
      herself. The fact that Solness cannot climb as high as he builds implies,
      I take it, that he cannot act as freely as he thinks, or as Hilda would
      goad him into thinking. At such an altitude his conscience would turn
      dizzy, and life would become impossible to him. But here I am straying
      back to the interpretation of symbols. My present purpose is to insist
      that there is nothing in the play which has no meaning on the
      natural-psychological plane, and absolutely requires a symbolic
      interpretation to make it comprehensible. The symbols are harmonic
      undertones; the psychological melody is clear and consistent without any
      reference to them.(4) It is true that, in order to accept the action on
      what we may call the realistic level, we must suppose Solness to possess
      and to exercise, sometimes unconsciously, a considerable measure of
      hypnotic power. But time is surely past when we could reckon hypnotism
      among "supernatural" phenomena. Whether the particular forms of hypnotic
      influence attributed to Solness do actually exist is a question we need
      not determine. The poet does not demand our absolute credence, as though
      he were giving evidence in the witness-box. What he requires is our
      imaginative acceptance of certain incidents which he purposely leaves
      hovering on the border between the natural and the preternatural, the
      explained and the unexplained. In this play, as in <i>The Lady from the
      Sea</i> and <i>Little Eyolf</i>, he shows a delicacy of art in his
      dalliance with the occult which irresistibly recalls the exquisite genius
      of Nathaniel Hawthorne.(5)
    </p>
    <p>
      The critics who insist on finding nothing but symbolism in the play have
      fastened on Mrs. Solness's "nine lovely dolls," and provided the most
      amazing interpretations for them. A letter which I contributed in 1893 to
      the <i>Westminster Gazette</i> records an incident which throws a curious
      light on the subject and may be worth preserving. "At a recent first
      night," I wrote, "I happened to be seated just behind a well-known critic.
      He turned round to me and said, 'I want you to tell me what is YOUR theory
      of those "nine lovely dolls." Of course one can see that they are entirely
      symbolical.' 'I am not so sure of that,' I replied, remembering a
      Norwegian cousin of my own who treasured a favourite doll until she was
      nearer thirty than twenty. 'They of course symbolise the unsatisfied
      passion of motherhood in Mrs. Solness's heart, but I have very little
      doubt that Ibsen makes use of this "symbol" because he has observed a
      similar case, or cases, in real life.' 'What!' cried the critic. 'He has
      seen a grown-up, a middle-aged woman continuing to "live with" her dolls!'
      I was about to say that it did not seem to me so very improbable, when a
      lady who was seated next me, a total stranger to both of us, leant forward
      and said, 'Excuse my interrupting you, but it may perhaps interest you to
      know that I HAVE THREE DOLLS TO WHICH I AM DEEPLY ATTACHED!' I will not be
      so rude as to conjecture this lady's age, but we may be sure that a very
      young woman would not have had the courage to make such an avowal. Does it
      not seem that Ibsen knows a thing or two about human nature&mdash;English
      as well as Norwegian&mdash;which we dramatic critics, though bound by our
      calling to be subtle psychologists, have not yet fathomed?" In the course
      of the correspondence which followed, one very apposite anecdote was
      quoted from an American paper, the <i>Argonaut</i>: "An old Virginia lady
      said to a friend, on finding a treasured old cup cracked by a careless
      maid, 'I know of nothing to compare with the affliction of losing a
      handsome piece of old china.' 'Surely,' said the friend, 'it is not so bad
      as losing one's children.' 'Yes, it is,' replied the old lady, 'for when
      your children die, you do have the consolations of religion, you know.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be a paradox to call <i>The Master Builder</i> Ibsen's greatest
      work, but one of his three or four greatest it assuredly is. Of all his
      writings, it is probably the most original, the most individual, the most
      unlike any other drama by any other writer. The form of <i>Brand</i> and
      <i>Peer Gynt</i> was doubtless suggested by other dramatic poems&mdash;notably
      by <i>Faust</i>. In <i>The Wild Duck</i>, in <i>Rosmersholm</i>, in <i>Hedda
      Gabler</i>, even in <i>Little Eyolf</i> and <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i>,
      there remain faint traces of the French leaven which is so strong in the
      earlier plays. But <i>The Master Builder</i> had no model and has no
      parallel. It shows no slightest vestige of outside influence. It is Ibsen,
      and nothing but Ibsen.

   retell the story, transplanting it to England and making the hero
   a journalist instead of an architect, in order to show that (if
   we grant the reality of certain commonly-accepted phenomena of
   hypnotism) there is nothing incredible or even extravagantly
   improbable about it.  The argument is far too long to be included

      <h2>
        ACT FIRST.
      </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A plainly-furnished work-room in the house of HALVARD SOLNESS.
  Folding doors on the left lead out to the hall.  On the right
  is the door leading to the inner rooms of the house.  At the
  back is an open door into the draughtsmen's office.  In front,
  on the left, a desk with books, papers and writing materials.
  Further back than the folding door, a stove.  In the right-
  hand corner, a sofa, a table, and one or two chairs.  On the
  table a water-bottle and glass.  A smaller table, with a
  rocking-chair and arm-chair, in front on the right.  Lighted
  lamps, with shades, on the table in the draughtmen's office,
  on the table in the corner, and on the desk.

  In the draughtsmen's office sit KNUT BROVIK and his son RAGNAR,
  occupied with plans and calculations.  At the desk in the outer
  office stands KAIA FOSLI, writing in the ledger.  KNUT BROVICK
  is a spare old man with white hair and beard.  He wears a
  rather threadbare but well-brushed black coat, with spectacles,
  and a somewhat discoloured white neckcloth.  RAGNAR BROVIK is
  a well-dressed, light-haired man in his thirties, with a
  slight stoop.  KAIA FOSLI is a slightly built girl, a little
  over twenty, carefully dressed, and delicate-looking.  She has
  a green shade over her eyes.&mdash;All three go on working for some
  time in silence.
</pre>
      KNUT BROVIK.
      <p>
        [Rises suddenly, as if in distress, from the table; breathes heavily and
        laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.] No, I can't bear it
        much longer!
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        [Going up to him.] You are feeling very ill this evening, are you not,
        Uncle?
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        Oh, I seem to get worse every day.
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        [Has risen and advances.] You ought to go home, father. Try to get a
        little sleep&mdash;
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        [Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        Then take a little walk.
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        Yes, do. I will come with you.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        [With warmth.] I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have it
        out this evening with&mdash;[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]&mdash;with
        him&mdash;with the chief.
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        [Anxiously.] Oh no, uncle,&mdash;do wait awhile before doing that!
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        Yes, better wait, father!
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        [Draws is breath laboriously.] Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;! <i>I</i> haven't much
        time for waiting.
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        [Listening.] Hush! I hear him on the stairs.
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [All three go back to their work.  A short silence.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  HALVARD SOLNESS comes in through the hall door.  He is a man no
  longer young, but healthy and vigorous, with close-cut curly
  hair, dark moustache and dark thick eyebrows.  He wears a
  greyish-green buttoned jacket with an upstanding collar and
  broad lapels.  On his head he wears a soft grey felt hat,
  and he has one or two light portfolios under his arm.
</pre>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Near the door, points towards the draughtsmen's office, and asks in a
        whisper:] Are they gone?
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        [Softly, shaking her] No.
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [She takes the shade off her eyes.  SOLNESS crosses the room,
       throws his hat on a chair, places the portfolios on the table
       by the sofa, and approaches the desk again.  KAIA goes on
       writing without intermission, but seems nervous and uneasy.
</pre>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Aloud.] What is that you are entering, Miss Fosli?
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        [Starts.] Oh, it is only something that&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Let me look at it, Miss Fosli. [Bends over her, pretends to be looking
        into the ledger, and whispers:] Kaia!
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        [Softly, still writing.] Well?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Why do you always take that shade off when I come?
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        [As before.] I look so ugly with it on.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Smiling.] Then you don't like to look ugly, Kaia?
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        [Half glancing up at him.] Not for all the world. Not in your eyes.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Strokes her hair gently.] Poor, poor little Kaia&mdash;
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        [Bending her head.] Hush&mdash;they can hear you!
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [SOLNESS strolls across the room to the right, turns and pauses
       at the door of the draughtsmen's office.
</pre>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Has any one been here for me?
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        [Rising.] Yes, the young couple who want a villa built, out at
        Lovstrand.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Growling.] Oh, those two! They must wait. I am not quite clear about
        the plans yet.
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        [Advancing, with some hesitation.] They were very anxious to have the
        drawings at once.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [As before.] Yes, of course&mdash;so they all are.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        [Looks up.] They say they are longing so to get into a house of their
        own.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, yes&mdash;we know all that! And so they are content to take
        whatever is offered them. They get a&mdash;a roof over their heads&mdash;an
        address&mdash;but nothing to call a home. No thank you! In that case,
        let them apply to somebody else. Tell them that, the next time they
        call.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        [Pushes his glasses up on to his forehead and looks in astonishment at
        him.] To somebody else? Are you prepared to give up the commission?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Impatiently.] Yes, yes, yes, devil take it! If that is to be the way of
        it&mdash;. Rather that, than build away at random. [Vehemently.]
        Besides, I know very little about these people as yet.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        The people are safe enough. Ragnar knows them. He is a friend of the
        family.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh, safe&mdash;safe enough! That is not at all what I mean. Good lord&mdash;don't
        you understand me either? [Angrily.] I won't have anything to do with
        these strangers. They may apply to whom they please, so far as I am
        concerned.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        [Rising.] Do you really mean that?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Sulkily.] Yes I do.&mdash;For once in a way. [He comes forward.
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [BROVIK exchanges a glance with RAGNAR, who makes a warning
       gesture.  Then BROVIK comes into the front room.
</pre>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        May I have a few words with you?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Certainly.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        [To KAIA.] Just go in there for moment, Kaia.
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        [Uneasily.] Oh, but uncle&mdash;
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        Do as I say, child. And shut the door after you.
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [KAIA goes reluctantly into the draughtsmen's office, glances
       anxiously and imploringly at SOLNESS, and shuts the door.
</pre>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        [Lowering his voice a little.] I don't want the poor children to know
        how I am.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, you have been looking very poorly of late.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        It will soon be all over with me. My strength is ebbing&mdash;from day
        to day.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Won't you sit down?
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        Thanks&mdash;may I?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Placing the arm-chair more conveniently.] Here&mdash;take this chair.&mdash;And
        now?
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        [Has seated himself with difficulty.] Well, you see, it's about Ragnar.
        That is what weighs most upon me. What is to become of him?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Of course your son will stay with me as long as ever he likes.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        But that is just what he does not like. He feels that he cannot stay
        here any longer.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Why, I should say he was very well off here. But if he wants more money,
        I should not mind&mdash;
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        No, no! It is not that. [Impatiently.] But sooner or later he, too, must
        have a chance of doing something on his own account.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Without looking at him.] Do you think that Ragnar has quite talent
        enough to stand alone?
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        No, that is just the heartbreaking part of it&mdash;I have begun to have
        my doubts about the boy. For you have never said so much as&mdash;as one
        encouraging word about him. And yet I cannot but think there must be
        something in him&mdash;he can't be without talent.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Well, but he has learnt nothing&mdash;nothing thoroughly, I mean.
        Except, of course, to draw.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        [Looks at him with covert hatred, and says hoarsely.] You had learned
        little enough of the business when you were in my employment. But that
        did not prevent you from setting to work&mdash;[breathing with
        difficulty]&mdash;and pushing your way up, and taking the wind out of my
        sails&mdash;mine, and so may other people's.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, you see&mdash;circumstances favoured me.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        You are right there. Everything favoured you. But then how can you have
        the heart to let me go to my grave&mdash;without having seen what Ragnar
        is fit for? And of course I am anxious to see them married, too&mdash;before
        I go.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Sharply.] Is it she who wishes it?
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        Not Kaia so much as Ragnar&mdash;he talks about it every day.
        [Appealingly.] You must help him to get some independent work now! I
        must see something that the lad has done. Do you hear?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Peevishly.] Hang it, man, you can't expect me to drag commissions down
        from the moon for him!
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        He has the chance of a capital commission at this very moment. A big bit
        of work.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Uneasily, startled.] Has he?
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        I you would give your consent.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        What sort of work do you mean?
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        [With some hesitation.] He can have the building of that villa out at
        Lovstrand.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        That! Why I am going to build that myself.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        Oh you don't much care about doing it.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Flaring up.] Don't care! Who dares to say that?
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        You said so yourself just now.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh, never mind what I say.&mdash;Would they give Ragnar the building of
        that villa?
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        Yes. You see, he knows the family. And then&mdash;just for the fun of
        the thing&mdash;he has made drawings and estimates and so forth&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Are they pleased with the drawings? The people who will have to live in
        the house?
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        Yes. If you would only look through them and approve of them&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Then they would let Ragnar build their home for them?
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        They were immensely pleased with his idea. They thought it exceedingly
        original, they said.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oho! Original! Not the old-fashioned stuff that <i>I</i> am in the habit
        of turning out!
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        It seemed to them different.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [With suppressed irritation.] So it was to see Ragnar that they came
        here&mdash;whilst I was out!
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        They came to call upon you&mdash;and at the same time to ask whether you
        would mind retiring&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Angrily.] Retire? I?
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        In case you thought that Ragnar's drawings&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I! Retire in favour of your son!
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        Retire from the agreement, they meant.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh, it comes to the same thing. [Laughs angrily.] So that is it, is it?
        Halvard Solness is to see about retiring now! To make room for younger
        men! For the very youngest, perhaps! He must make room! Room! Room!
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        Why, good heavens! there is surely room for more than one single man&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh, there's not so very much room to spare either. But, be that as it
        may&mdash;I will never retire! I will never give way to anybody! Never
        of my own free will. Never in this world will I do that!
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        [Rise with difficulty.] Then I am to pass out of life without any
        certainty? Without a gleam of happiness? Without any faith or trust in
        Ragnar? Without having seen a single piece of work of his doing? Is that
        to be the way of it?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Turns half aside, and mutters.] H'm&mdash;don't ask more just now.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        I must have an answer to this one question. Am I to pass out of life in
        such utter poverty?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Seems to struggle with himself; finally he says, in a low but firm
        voice:] You must pass out of life as best you can.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        Then be it so. [He goes up the room.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Following him, half is desperation.] Don't you understand that I cannot
        help it? I am what I am, and I cannot change my nature!
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        No; I suppose that you can't. [Reels and supports himself against the
        sofa-table.] May I have a glass of water?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        By all means. [Fills a glass and hands it to him.
      </p>
      BROVIK.
      <p>
        Thanks. [Drinks and puts the glass down again.

      KAIA.
      <p>
        Ragnar and Uncle say I must. So I suppose I shall have to give in.

      KAIA.
      <p>
        I cared very much for Ragnar once&mdash;before I came here to you.

        care for any one else.

      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Repudiating the idea.] No, no, that is quite impossible. If Ragnar
        leaves me and starts work on his own account, then of course he will
        need you himself.

      KAIA.

        him as much as you please&mdash;[Alters his tone.] I mean&mdash;don't
        let him throw up his good situation with me. For then I can keep you
        too, my dear Kaia.

        Oh yes, how lovely that would be, if it could only be managed!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>

      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No other than her own suspicious nature.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        I know you have known a good many women in your time.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, I have.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        And have been a good deal taken with some of them, too.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh yes, I don't deny it.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        But as regards Miss Fosli, then? There is nothing of that sort in this
        case?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No; nothing at all&mdash;on my side.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        But on her side?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I don't think you have any right to ask that question, doctor.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Well, you know, we were discussing your wife's intuition.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        So we were. And for that matter&mdash;[lowers his voice]&mdash;Aline's
        intuition, as you call it&mdash;in a certain sense, it has not been so
        far astray.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Aha! there we have it!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Sits down.] Doctor Herdal&mdash;I am going to tell you a strange story&mdash;if
        you care to listen to it.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        I like listening to strange stories.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Very well then. I daresay you recollect that I took Knut Brovik and his
        son into my employment&mdash;after the old man's business had gone to
        the dogs.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Yes, so I have understood.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        You see, they really are clever fellows, these two. Each of them has
        talent in his own way. But then the son took it into his head to get
        engaged; and the next thing, of course, was that he wanted to get
        married&mdash;and begin to build on his own account. That is the way
        with all these young people.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        [Laughing.] Yes, they have a bad habit of wanting to marry.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Just so. But of course that did not suit my plans; for I needed Ragnar
        myself&mdash;and the old man too. He is exceedingly good at calculating
        bearing strains and cubic contents&mdash;and all that sort of devilry,
        you know.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Oh yes, no doubt that's indispensable.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, it is. But Ragnar was absolutely bent on setting to work for
        himself. He would hear of nothing else.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        But he has stayed with you all the same.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, I'll tell you how that came about. One day this girl, Kaia Fosli,
        came to see them on some errand or other. She had never been here
        before. And when I saw how utterly infatuated they were with each other,
        the thought occurred to me: if I cold only get her into the office here,
        then perhaps Ragnar too would stay where he is.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        That was not at all a bad idea.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, but at the time I did not breathe a word of what was in my mind. I
        merely stood and looked at her&mdash;and kept on wishing intently that I
        could have her here. Then I talked to her a little, in a friendly way&mdash;about
        one thing and another. And then she went away.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Well?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Well then, next day, pretty late in the evening, when old Brovik and
        Ragnar had gone home, she came here again, and behaved as if I had made
        an arrangement with her.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        An arrangement? What about?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        About the very thing my mind had been fixed on. But I hadn't said one
        single word about it.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        That was most extraordinary.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, was it not? And now she wanted to know what she was to do here&mdash;whether
        she could begin the very next morning, and so forth.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Don't you think she did it in order to be with her sweetheart?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        That was what occurred to me at first. But no, that was not it. She
        seemed to drift quite away from him&mdash;when once she had come here to
        me.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        She drifted over to you, then?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, entirely. If I happen to look at her when her back is turned, I can
        tell that she feels it. She quivers and trembles the moment I come near
        her. What do you think of that?
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        H'm&mdash;that's not very hard to explain.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Well, but what about the other thing? That she believed I had said to
        her what I had only wished and willed&mdash;silently&mdash;inwardly&mdash;to
        myself? What do you say to that? Can you explain that, Dr. Herdal?
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        No, I won't undertake to do that.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I felt sure you would not; and so I have never cared to talk about it
        till now.&mdash;But it's a cursed nuisance to me in the long run, you
        understand. Here have I got to go on day after day, pretending&mdash;.
        And it's a shame to treat her so, too, poor girl. [Vehemently.] But I
        cannot do anything else. For if she runs away from me&mdash;then Ragnar
        will be off too.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        And you have not told your wife the rights of the story?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        The why on earth don't you?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Looks fixedly at him, and says in a low voice:] Because I seem to find
        a sort of&mdash;of salutary self-torture in allowing Aline to do me an
        injustice.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        [Shakes his head.] I don't in the least understand what you mean.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Well, you see&mdash;it is like paying off a little bit of a huge,
        immeasurable debt&mdash;
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        To your wife?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes; and that always helps to relieve one's mind a little. One can
        breathe more freely for a while, you understand.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        No, goodness knows, I don't understand at all&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Breaking off, rises again.] Well, well, well&mdash;then we won't talk
        any more about it. [He saunters across the room, returns, and stops
        beside the table. Looks at the doctor with a sly smile.] I suppose you
        think you have drawn me out nicely now, doctor?
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        [With some irritation.] Drawn you out? Again I have not the faintest
        notion of what you mean, Mr. Solness.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh come, out with it; I have seen it quite clearly, you know.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        What have you seen?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [In a low voice, slowly.] That you have been quietly keeping an eye upon
        me.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        That <i>I</i> have! And why in all the world should I do that?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Because you think that I&mdash;&mdash; [Passionately.] Well devil take
        it&mdash;you think the same of me as Aline does.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        And what does she think about you?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Having recovered his self-control.] She has begun to think that I am&mdash;that
        I am&mdash;ill.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Ill! You! She has never hinted such a thing to me. Why, what can she
        think is the matter with you?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Leans over the back of the chair and whispers.] Aline has made up her
        mind that I am mad. That is what she thinks.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        [Rising.] Why, my dear fellow&mdash;!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, on my soul she does! I tell you it is so. And she has got you to
        think the same! Oh, I can assure you, doctor, I see it in your face as
        clearly as possible. You don't take me in so easily, I can tell you.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        [Looks at him in amazement.] Never, Mr. Solness&mdash;never has such a
        thought entered my mind.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [With and incredulous smile.] Really? Has it not?
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        No, never! Nor your wife's mind either, I am convinced. I could almost
        swear to that.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Well, I wouldn't advise you to. For, in a certain sense, you see,
        perhaps&mdash;perhaps she is not so far wrong in thinking something of
        the kind.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Come now, I really must say&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Interrupting, with a sweep of his hand.] Well, well, my dear doctor&mdash;don't
        let us discuss this any further. We had better agree to differ. [Changes
        to a tone of quiet amusement.] But look here now, doctor&mdash;h'm&mdash;
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Well?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Since you don't believe that I am&mdash;ill&mdash;and crazy&mdash;and
        mad, and so forth&mdash;
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        What then?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Then I daresay you fancy that I am an extremely happy man.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Is that mere fancy?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Laughs.] No, no&mdash;of course not! Heaven forbid! Only think&mdash;to
        be Solness the master builder! Halvard Solness! What could be more
        delightful?
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Yes, I must say it seems to me you have had the luck on your side to an
        astounding degree.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Suppresses a gloomy smile.] So I have. I can't complain on that score.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        First of all that grim old robbers' castle was burnt down for you. And
        that was certainly a great piece of luck.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Seriously.] It was the home of Aline's family. Remember that.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Yes, it must have been a great grief to her.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        She has not got over it to this day&mdash;not in all these twelve or
        thirteen years.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        But you&mdash;yourself&mdash;you rose upon the ruins. You began as a
        poor boy from a country village&mdash;and now you are at the head of
        your profession. Ah, yes, Mr. Solness, you have undoubtedly had the luck
        on your side.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Looking at him with embarrassment.] Yes, but that is just what makes me
        so horribly afraid.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Afraid? Because you have the luck on your side!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        It terrifies me&mdash;terrifies me every hour of the day. For sooner or
        later the luck must turn, you see.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Oh nonsense! What should make the luck turn?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [With firm assurance.] The younger generation!
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Pooh! The younger generation! You are not laid on the shelf yet, I
        should hope. Oh no&mdash;your position here is probably firmer now than
        it has ever been.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        The luck will turn. I know it&mdash;I feel the day approaching. Some one
        or other will take it into his head to say: Give me a chance! And then
        all the rest will come clamouring after him, and shake their fists at me
        and shout: Make room&mdash;make room&mdash;! Yes, just you see, doctor&mdash;presently
        the younger generation will come knocking at my door&mdash;
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        [Laughing.] Well, and what if they do?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        What if they do? Then there's an end of Halvard Solness.
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [There is a knock at the door on the left.
</pre>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Starts.] What's that? Did you not hear something?
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Some one is knocking at the door.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Loudly.] Come in.
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  HILDA WANGEL enters by the hall door.  She is of middle height,
  supple, and delicately built.  Somewhat sunburnt.  Dressed in
  a tourist costume, with skirt caught up for walking, a sailor's
  collar open at the throat, and a small sailor hat on her head.
  Knapsack on back, plaid in strap, and alpenstock.
</pre>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Goes straight up to SOLNESS, her eyes sparkling with happiness.] Good
        evening!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Looks doubtfully at her.] Good evening&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Laughs.] I almost believe you don't recognise me!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No&mdash;I must admit that&mdash;just for the moment&mdash;
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        [Approaching.] But <i>I</i> recognise you, my dear young lady&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Pleased.] Oh, is it you that&mdash;
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Of course it is. [To SOLNESS.] We met at one of the mountain stations
        this summer. [To HILDA.] What became of the other ladies?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Oh, they went westward.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        They didn't much like all the fun we used to have in the evenings.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        No, I believe they didn't.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        [Holds up his finger at her.] And I am afraid it can't be denied that
        you flirted a little with us.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Well, that was better fun than to sit there knitting stockings with all
        those old women.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        [Laughs.] There I entirely agree with you!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Have you come to town this evening?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, I have just arrived.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Quite alone, Miss Wangel?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Oh yes!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Wangel? Is your name Wangel?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks in amused surprise at him.] Yes, of course it is.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Then you must be a daughter of the district doctor up at Lysanger?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [As before.] Yes, who else's daughter should I be?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh, then I suppose we met up there, that summer when I was building a
        tower on the old church.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [More seriously.] Yes, of course it was then we met.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Well, that is a long time ago.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks hard at him.] It is exactly ten years.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        You must have been a mere child then, I should think.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Carelessly.] Well, I was twelve or thirteen.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Is this the first time you have ever been up to town, Miss Wangel?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, it is indeed.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        And don't you know any one here?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Nobody but you. And of course, your wife.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        So you know her, too?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Only a little. We spent a few days together at the sanatorium.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Ah, up there?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        She said I might come and pay her a visit if ever I came up to town.
        [Smiles.] Not that that was necessary.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Odd that she should never have mentioned it.
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [HILDA puts her stick down by the stove, takes off the knapsack
       and lays it and the plaid on the sofa.  DR. HERDAL offers to
       help her.  SOLNESS stands and gazes at her.
</pre>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Going towards him.] Well, now I must ask you to let me stay the night
        here.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I am sure there will be no difficulty about that.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        For I have no other clothes than those I stand in, except a change of
        linen in my knapsack. And that has to go to the wash, for it's very
        dirty.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh yes, that can be managed. Now I'll just let my wife know&mdash;
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Meanwhile I will go and see my patient.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, do; and come again later on.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        [Playfully, with a glance at HILDA.] Oh that I will, you may be very
        certain! [Laughs.] So your prediction has come true, Mr. Solness!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        How so?
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        The younger generation did come knocking at your door.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Cheerfully.] Yes, but in a very different way from what I meant.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Very different, yes. That's undeniable.

     [He goes out by the hall-door.  SOLNESS opens the door on the
       right and speaks into the side room.

        Aline! Will you come in here, please. Here is a friend of yours&mdash;Miss
        Wangel.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Appears in the doorway.] Who do you say it is? [Sees HILDA.]. Oh, is it
        you, Miss Wangel?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Miss Wangel has this moment arrived; and she would like to stay the
        night here.

      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Here with us? Oh yes, certainly.

      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I will do the best I can for you. It's no more than my duty. I suppose
        your trunk is coming on later?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I have no trunk.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Well, it will be all right, I daresay. In the meantime, you must excuse
        my leaving you here with my husband, until I can get a room made a
        little more comfortable for you.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Can we not give her one of the nurseries? They are all ready as it is.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh yes. There we have room and to spare. [To HILDA.] Sit down now, and

     [HILDA, with her hands behind her back, strolls about the room
       and looks at various objects.  SOLNESS stands in front, beside
       the table, also with his hands behind his back, and follows
       her with his eyes.

      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Stops and looks at him.] Have you several nurseries?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        There are three nurseries in the house.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        That's a lot. Then I suppose you have a great many children?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No. We have no child. But now you can be the child here, for the time
        being.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        For to-night, yes. I shall not cry. I mean to sleep as sound as a stone.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, you must be very tired, I should think.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh no! But all the same&mdash;. It's so delicious to lie and dream.

        Do you dream much of nights?

        Oh yes! Almost always.

        here. [Looks smilingly at him.] Don't you think so, too?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Of course. First of all, I suppose, you want to make a round of the
        shops, and get yourself up in the height of fashion.

        Ah yes, those flags&mdash;I can tell you I remember them!

        you had a great wreath with you; and you hung that wreath right away up
        on the weather-vane.

        will have happened, too. For one of those white-frocked little devils,&mdash;she
        went on in such a way, and screamed up at me so&mdash;

        [Lively again.] Oh, it was so gloriously thrilling! I could not have
        believed there was a builder in the whole world that could build such a
        tremendously high tower. And then, that you yourself should stand at the
        very top of it, as large as life! And that you should not be the least
        bit dizzy! It was that above everything that made one&mdash;made one
        dizzy to think of.

        Yes, to be sure. It must have been the same afternoon, for I left the
        place next morning.

      HILDA.

        And from the Club you were invited to come round to our house to supper.

        Quite right, Miss Wangel. It is wonderful how all these trifles have

        feeling so buoyant and free that day&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        And then you said that when I grew up I should be your princess.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Laughing a little.] Dear, dear&mdash;did I say that too?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, you did. And when I asked how long I should have to wait, you said
        that you would come again in ten years&mdash;like a troll&mdash;and
        carry me off&mdash;to Spain or some such place. And you promised you
        would buy me a kingdom there.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [As before.] Yes, after a good dinner one doesn't haggle about the
        halfpence. But did I really say all that?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Laughs to herself.] Yes. And you told me, too, what the kingdom was to
        be called.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Well, what was it?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        It was to be called the kingdom of Orangia,* you said.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  *In the original "Appelsinia," "appelsin" meaning "orange."

      </p>
      HILDA.

        No, I didn't like it a bit; for it seemed as though you wanted to make
        game of me.

        Well, that's the finishing touch, if you have forgotten that too. I
        should have thought no one could help remembering such a thing as that.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, yes, just give me a hint, and then perhaps&mdash;&mdash; Well?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks fixedly at him.] You came and kissed me, Mr. Solness.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Open-mouthed.] <i>I</i> did!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, indeed you did. You took me in both your arms, and bent my head
        back, and kissed me&mdash;many times.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Now really, my dear Miss Wangel&mdash;!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Rises.] You surely cannot mean to deny it?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, I do. I deny it altogether!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks scornfully at him.] Oh, indeed!
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       [She turns and goes slowly up to the stove, where she remains
       standing motionless, her face averted from him, her hands
       behind her back.  Short pause.
</pre>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Goes cautiously up behind her.] Miss Wangel&mdash;!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Is silent and does not move.]
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Don't stand there like a statue. You must have dreamt all this. [Lays
        his hand on her arm.] Now just listen&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Makes an impatient movement with her arm.]
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [As a thought flashes upon him.] Or&mdash;! Wait a moment! There is
        something under all this, you may depend!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Does not move.]
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [In a low voice, but with emphasis.] I must have thought all that. I
        must have wished it&mdash;have willed it&mdash;have longed to do it. And
        then&mdash;. May not that be the explanation.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Is still silent.]
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Impatiently.] Oh very well, deuce take it all&mdash;then I did do it, I
        suppose.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Turns her head a little, but without looking at him.] Then you admit it
        now?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes&mdash;whatever you like.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        You came and put your arms round me?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh yes!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        And bent my head back?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Very far back.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        And kissed me?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, I did.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Many times?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        As many as ever you like.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Turns quickly toward him and has once more the sparkling expression of
        gladness in her eyes.] Well, you see, I got it out of you at last!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [With a slight smile.] Yes&mdash;just think of my forgetting such a
        thing as that.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Again a little sulky, retreats from him.] Oh, you have kissed so many
        people in your time, I suppose.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No, you mustn't think that of me. [HILDA seats herself in the arm-chair.
        SOLNESS stands and leans against the rocking-chair. Looks observantly at
        her.] Miss Wangel!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        How was it now? What came of all this&mdash;between us two.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Why, nothing more came of it. You know that quite well. For then the
        other guests came in, and then&mdash;bah!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Quite so! The others came in. To think of my forgetting that too!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Oh, you haven't really forgotten anything: you are only a little ashamed
        of it all. I am sure one doesn't forget things of that kind.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No, one would suppose not.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Lively again, looks at him.] Perhaps you have even forgotten what day
        it was?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        What day&mdash;?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, on what day did you hang the wreath on the tower? Well? Tell me at
        once!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        H'm&mdash;I confess I have forgotten the particular day. I only know it
        was ten years ago. Some time in autumn.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Nods her head slowly several times.] It was ten years ago&mdash;on the
        19th of September.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, it must have been about that time. Fancy your remembering that too!
        [Stops.] But wait a moment&mdash;! Yes&mdash;it's the 19th of September
        today.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, it is; and the ten years are gone. And you didn't come&mdash;as you
        had promised me.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Promised you? Threatened, I suppose you mean?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I don't think there was any sort of threat in that.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Well then, a little bit of fun.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Was that all you wanted? To make fun of me?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Well, or to have a little joke with you. Upon my soul, I don't
        recollect. But it must have been something of that kind; for you were a
        mere child then.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Oh, perhaps I wasn't quite such a child either. Not such a mere chit as
        you imagine.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Looks searchingly at her.] Did you really and seriously expect me to
        come again?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Conceals a half-teasing smile.] Yes, indeed! I did expect that of you.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        That I should come back to your home, and take you away with me?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Just like a troll&mdash;yes.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        And make a princess of you?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        That's what you promised.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        And give you a kingdom as well?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks up at the ceiling.] Why not? Of course it need not have been an
        actual, every-day sort of a kingdom.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        But something else just as good?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, at least as good. [Looks at him a moment.] I thought, if you could
        build the highest church-towers in the world, you could surely manage to
        raise a kingdom of one sort or another as well.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Shakes his head.] I can't quite make you out, Miss Wangel.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Can you not? To me it seems all so simple.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No, I can't make up my mind whether you mean all you say, or are simply
        having a joke with me.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Smiles.] Making fun of you, perhaps? I, too?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, exactly. Making fun&mdash;of both of us. [Looks at her.] Is it long
        since you found out that I was married?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I have know it all along. Why do you ask me that?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Lightly.] Oh, well, it just occurred to me. [Looks earnestly at her,
        and says in a low voice.] What have you come for?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I want my kingdom. The time is up.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Laughs involuntarily.] What a girl you are!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Gaily.] Out with my kingdom, Mr. Solness! [Raps with her fingers.] The
        kingdom on the table!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Pushing the rocking-chair nearer and sitting down.] Now, seriously
        speaking&mdash;what have you come for? What do you really want to do
        here?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Oh, first of all, I want to go round and look at all the things that you
        have built.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        That will give you plenty of exercise.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, I know you have built a tremendous lot.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I have indeed&mdash;especially of late years.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Many church-towers among the rest? Immensely high ones?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No. I build no more church-towers now. Nor churches either.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        What do you build then?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Homes for human beings.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Reflectively.] Couldn't you build a little&mdash;a little bit of a
        church-tower over these homes as well?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Starting.] What do you mean by that?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I mean&mdash;something that points&mdash;points up into the free air.
        With the vane at a dizzy height.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Pondering a little.] Strange that you should say that&mdash;for that is
        just what I am most anxious to do.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Impatiently.] Why don't you do it, then?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Shakes his head.] No, the people will not have it.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Fancy their not wanting it!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [More lightly.] But now I am building a new home for myself&mdash;just
        opposite here.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        For yourself?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes. It is almost finished. And on that there is a tower.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        A high tower?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Very high?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No doubt people will say it is too high&mdash;too high for a
        dwelling-house.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I'll go out to look at that tower first thing to-morrow morning.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Sits resting his cheek on his hand, and gazes at her.] Tell me, Miss
        Wangel&mdash;what is your name? Your Christian name, I mean.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Why, Hilda, of course.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [As before.] Hilda? Indeed?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Don't you remember that? You called me Hilda yourself&mdash;that day
        when you misbehaved.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Did I really.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        But then you said "little Hilda"; and I didn't like that.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh, you didn't like that, Miss Hilda?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        No, not at such a time as that. But&mdash;"Princess Hilda"&mdash;that
        will sound very well, I think.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Very well indeed. Princess Hilda of&mdash;of&mdash;what was to be the
        name of the kingdom?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Pooh! I won't have anything to do with that stupid kingdom. I have set
        my heart upon quite a different one!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Has leaned back in the chair, still gazing at her.] Isn't it strange&mdash;?
        The more I think of it now, the more it seems to me as though I had gone
        about all these years torturing myself with&mdash;h'm&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        With what?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        With the effort to recover something&mdash;some experience, which I
        seemed to have forgotten. But I never had the least inkling of what it
        could be.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        You should have tied a knot in your pocket-handkerchief, Mr. Solness.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        In that case, I should simply have had to go racking my brains to
        discover what the knot could mean.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Oh yes, I suppose there are trolls of that kind in the world, too.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Rises slowly.] What a good thing it is that you have come to me now.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks deeply into his eyes.] Is it a good thing!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        For I have been so lonely here. I have been gazing so helplessly at it
        all. [In a lower voice.] I must tell you&mdash;I have begun to be afraid
        of the younger generation.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [With a little snort of contempt.] Pooh&mdash;is the younger generation
        something to be afraid of?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        It is indeed. And that is why I have locked and barred myself in.
        [Mysteriously.] I tell you the younger generation will one day come and
        thunder at my door! They will break in upon me!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Then I should say you ought to go out and open the door to the younger
        generation.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Open the door?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes. Let them come in to you on friendly terms, as it were.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No, no, no! The younger generation&mdash;it means retribution, you see.
        It comes, as if under a new banner, heralding the turn of fortune.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Rises, looks at him, and says with a quivering twitch of her lips.] Can
        <i>I</i> be of any use to you, Mr. Solness?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, you can indeed! For you, too, come&mdash;under a new banner it
        seems to me. You marshalled against youth&mdash;!
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  DR. HERDAL comes in by the hall-door.

      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        What&mdash;you and Miss Wangel here still?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes. We have had no end of things to talk about.

        Oh, it has been the greatest fun. For Mr. Solness&mdash;he has such a

        Yes, the middle one. But first let us go in to supper.

        [Looks at him.] Hilda?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, Miss Wangel's name is Hilda. I knew her when she was a child.

      MRS. SOLNESS.

        Did you really, Halvard? Well, shall we go?

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A prettily furnished small drawing-room in SOLNESS'S house.
  In the back, a glass-door leading out to the verandah and
  garden.  The right-hand corner is cut off transversely by
  a large bay-window, in which are flower-stands.  The left-
  hand corner is similarly cut off by a transverse wall, in
  which is a small door papered like the wall.  On each side,
  an ordinary door.  In front, on the right, a console table
  with a large mirror over it.  Well-filled stands of plants
  and flowers.  In front, on the left, a sofa with a table
  and chairs.  Further back, a bookcase.  Well forward in the
  room, before the bay window, a small table and some chairs.
  It is early in the day.

  SOLNESS sits by the little table with RAGNAR BROVIK'S
  portfolio open in front of him.  He is turning the drawings
  over and closely examining some of them.  MRS. SOLNESS moves
  about noiselessly with a small watering-pot, attending to her
  flowers.  She is dressed in black as before.  Her hat, cloak
  and parasol lie on a chair near the mirror.  Unobserved by her,
  SOLNESS now and again follows her with his eyes.  Neither of
  them speaks.

  KAIA FOSLI enters quietly by the door on the left.
</pre>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:] Well, is
        that you?

      KAIA.
      <p>
        I merely wished to let you know that I have come.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
        coming presently to hear&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        How is the old man to-day?
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
        to-day.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.
      </p>
      KAIA.
      <p>
        Yes. [Pauses at the door.] Do you wish to speak to Ragnar when he comes?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No&mdash;I don't know that I have anything particular to say to him.

      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Without answering.] Yes, yes&mdash;depend upon it, Halvard, old Brovik

      <p>
        Yes, we have.

        then.

      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Stops suddenly and looks at her.] Do I? And why should I do that? Put

      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh yes, Halvard, I understand you very well. You are so anxious to spare
        me&mdash;and to find excuses for me too&mdash;as much as ever you can.

      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Ah, that is exactly what I cannot help thinking about. And now, at last,
        I must speak about it, too; for I don't seem to be able to bear it any
        longer. And then never to be able to forgive myself&mdash;

        [Exclaiming.] Yourself&mdash;!
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, for I had duties on both sides&mdash;both towards you and towards
        the little ones. I ought to have hardened myself&mdash;not to have let
        the horror take such hold upon me&mdash;nor the grief for the burning of
        my home. [Wrings her hands.] Oh, Halvard, if I had only had the
        strength!

        hopeless! Never a ray of sunlight! Not so much as a gleam of brightness
        to light up our home!

        Oh no, you may well say that. [Gloomily.] And God knows whether you are
        not right in saying that it will be no better for us in the new house,
        either.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        It will never be any better. Just as empty&mdash;just as desolate&mdash;there
        as here.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Vehemently.] Why in all the world have we built it then? Can you tell
        me that?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No; you must answer that question for yourself.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Glances suspiciously at her.] What do you mean by that, Aline?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        What do I mean?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, in the devil's name! You said it so strangely&mdash;as if you had
        some hidden meaning in it.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.

        No, indeed, I assure you&mdash;

      SOLNESS.

        eyes and my ears about me, Aline&mdash;you may depend upon that!

        kind of lurking, hidden meaning in the most innocent word I happen to
        say?

        on your hands&mdash;

        [Making a motion to throw her arms round her neck.] Oh, you dear, Mrs.
        Solness! You are really much too kind to me! Frightfully kind&mdash;
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Deprecatingly, freeing herself.] Oh, not at all. It's only my duty, so
        I am very glad to do it.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Offended, pouts.] But really, I think I am quite fit to be seen in the
        streets&mdash;now that I've put my dress to rights. Or do you think I am
        not?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        To tell you the truth, I think people would stare at you a little.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Contemptuously.] Pooh! Is that all? That only amuses me.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [With suppressed ill-humour.] Yes, but people might take it into their
        heads that you were mad too, you see.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Mad? Are there so many mad people here in town, then?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Points to his own forehead.] Here you see one at all events.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        You&mdash;Mr. Solness!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Have you not noticed that yet?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        No, I certainly have not. [Reflects and laughs a little.] And yet&mdash;perhaps
        in one single thing.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Ah, do you hear that, Aline?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        What is that one single thing, Miss Wangel?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        No, I won't say.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh yes, do!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        No thank you&mdash;I am not so mad as that.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        When you and Miss Wangel are alone, I daresay she will tell you,
        Halvard.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Ah&mdash;you think she will?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh yes, certainly. For you have known her so well in the past. Ever
        since she was a child&mdash;you tell me.
      </p>

      HILDA.
      <p>
        [After a little while.] Does your wife dislike me very much?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Did you think you noticed anything of the kind?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Did you notice it yourself?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Evasively.] Aline has become exceedingly shy with strangers of late
        years.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Has she really?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        But if only you could get to know her thoroughly&mdash;! Ah, she is so
        good&mdash;so kind&mdash;so excellent a creature&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Impatiently.] But if she is all that&mdash;what made her say that about
        her duty?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Her duty?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        She said that she would go out and buy something for me, because it was
        her duty. Oh, I can't bear that ugly, horrid word!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Why not?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        It sounds so could and sharp, and stinging. Duty&mdash;duty&mdash;duty.
        Don't you think so, too? Doesn't it seem to sting you?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        H'm&mdash;haven't thought much about it.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, it does. And if she is so good&mdash;as you say she is&mdash;why
        should she talk in that way?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        But, good Lord, what would you have had her say, then?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        She might have said she would do it because she had taken a tremendous
        fancy to me. She might have said something like that&mdash;something
        really warm and cordial, you understand.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Looks at her.] Is that how you would like to have it?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, precisely. [She wanders about the room, stops at the bookcase and
        looks at the books.] What a lot of books you have.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, I have got together a good many.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Do you read them all, too?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I used to try to. Do you read much?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        No, never! I have given it up. For it all seems so irrelevant.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        That is just my feeling.

        No, they are drawn by a young man whom I employ to help me.

        Some one you have taught?

        Pooh&mdash;these scrawlings! But if he has been learning from you&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh, so far as that goes&mdash;there are plenty of people here that have
        learnt from me, and have come to little enough for all that.

        Stupid? Do you think I am so very stupid?
      </p>
      HILDA.

        Yes, I do indeed. If you are content to go about here teaching all these
        people&mdash;

      <p>
        [With a slight start.] Well, and why not?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Rises, half serious, half laughing.] No indeed, Mr. Solness! What can
        be the good of that? No one but you should be allowed to build. You
        should stand quite alone&mdash;do it all yourself. Now you know it.

      SOLNESS.
      <p>

        that very thought.
      </p>

        Yes, that seems to me perfectly natural.

        Yes?

        That new house, you mean?

        The one that is being built, yes. Almost finished.

      HILDA.
      <p>
        It seems to have a very high tower.

      <p>
        The scaffolding is still up.

      <p>
        Yes.

        That&mdash;?
      </p>

      <p>
        That you are a little&mdash;a little mad after all.
      </p>

        Yes, of all the empty nurseries I slept in.

        [Looks eagerly at him.] Have you&mdash;?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Two little boys. They were of the same age.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Twins, then.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.

        then?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [With quiet emotion.] We kept them only about three weeks. Or scarcely
        so much. [Bursts forth.] Oh, Hilda, I can't tell you what a good thing
        it is for me that you have come! For now at last I have some one to talk
        to!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Can you not talk to&mdash;her, too?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Not about this. Not as I want to talk and must talk. [Gloomily.] And not
        about so many other things, either.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [In a subdued voice.] Was that all you meant when you said you need me?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        That was mainly what I meant&mdash;at all events, yesterday. For to-day
        I am not so sure&mdash;[Breaking off.] Come here and let us sit down,
        Hilda. Sit there on the sofa&mdash;so that you can look into the garden.
        [HILDA seats herself in the corner of the sofa. SOLNESS brings a chair
        closer.] Should you like to hear about it?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, I shall love to sit and listen to you.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Sits down.] Then I will tell you all about it.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Now I can see both the garden and you, Mr. Solness. So now, tell away!
        Begin!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Points towards the bow-window.] Out there on the rising ground&mdash;where
        you see the new house&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Aline and I lived there in the first years of our married life. There
        was an old house up there that had belonged to her mother; and we
        inherited it, and the whole of the great garden with it.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Was there a tower on that house, too?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No, nothing of the kind. From the outside it looked like a great, dark,
        ugly wooden box; but all the same, it was snug and comfortable enough
        inside.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Then did you pull down the ramshackle old place?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No, it was burnt down.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        The whole of it?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Was that a great misfortune for you?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        That depends on how you look at it. As a builder, the fire was the
        making of me&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Well, but&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        It was just after the birth of the two little boys&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        The poor little twins, yes.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        They came healthy and bonny into the world. And they were growing too&mdash;you
        could see the difference day to day.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Little children do grow quickly at first.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        It was the prettiest sight in the world to see Aline lying with the two
        of them in her arms.&mdash;But then came the night of the fire&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Excitedly.] What happened? Do tell me! Was any one burnt?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No, not that. Every one got safe and sound out of the house&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Well, and what then&mdash;?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        The fright had shaken Aline terribly. The alarm&mdash;the escape&mdash;the
        break-neck hurry&mdash;and then the ice-cold night air&mdash;for they
        had to be carried out just as they lay&mdash;both she and the little
        ones.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Was it too much for them?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh no, they stood it well enough. But Aline fell into a fever, and it
        affected her milk. She would insist on nursing them herself; because it
        was her duty, she said. And both our little boys, they&mdash;[Clenching
        his hands.]&mdash;they&mdash;oh!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        They did not get over that?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No, that they did not get over. That was how we lost them.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        It must have been terribly hard for you.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Hard enough for me; but ten time harder for Aline. [Clenching his hands
        in suppressed fury.] Oh, that such things should be allowed to happen
        here the world! [Shortly and firmly.] From the day I lost them, I had no
        heart for building churches.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Did you not like building the church-tower in our town?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I didn't like it. I know how free and happy I felt when that tower was
        finished.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        <i>I</i> know that, too.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        And now I shall never&mdash;never build anything of that sort again!
        Neither churches nor church-towers.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Nods slowly.] Nothing but houses for people to live in.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Homes for human beings, Hilda.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        But homes with high towers and pinnacles upon them.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        If possible. [Adopts a lighter tone.] But, as I said before, that fire
        was the making of me&mdash;as a builder, I mean.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Why don't you call yourself an architect, like the others?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I have not been systematically enough taught for that. Most of what I
        know I have found out for myself.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        But you succeeded all the same.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, thanks to the fire. I laid out almost the whole of the garden in
        villa lots; and there I was able to build after my own heart. So I came
        to the front with a rush.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks keenly at him.] You must surely be a very happy man, as matters
        stand with you.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Gloomily.] Happy? Do you say that, too&mdash;like all the rest of them?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, I should say you must be. If you could only cease thing about the
        two little children&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Slowly.] The two little children&mdash;they are not so easy to forget,
        Hilda.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Somewhat uncertainly.] Do you still feel their loss so much&mdash;after
        all these years?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Looks fixedly at her, without replying.] A happy man you said&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Well, now, are you not happy&mdash;in other respects?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Continues to look at her.] When I told you all this about the fire&mdash;h'm&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Well?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Was there not one special thought that you&mdash;that you seized upon?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Reflects in vain.] No. What thought should that be?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [With subdued emphasis.] It was simply and solely by that fire that I
        was enabled to build homes for human beings. Cosy, comfortable, bright
        homes, where father and mother and the whole troop of children can live
        in safety and gladness, feeling what a happy thing it is to be alive in
        the world&mdash;and most of all to belong to each other&mdash;in great
        things and in small.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Ardently.] Well, and is it not a great happiness for you to be able to
        build such beautiful homes?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        The price, Hilda! The terrible price I had to pay for the opportunity!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        But can you never get over that?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No. That I might build homes for others, I had to forego&mdash;to forego
        for all time&mdash;the home that might have been my own. I mean a home
        for a troop of children&mdash;and for father and mother, too.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Cautiously.] But need you have done that? For all time, you say?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Nods slowly.] That was the price of this happiness that people talk
        about. [Breathes heavily.] This happiness&mdash;h'm&mdash;this happiness
        was not to be bought any cheaper, Hilda.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [As before.] But may it not come right even yet?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Never in this world&mdash;never. That is another consequence of the fire&mdash;and
        of Aline's illness afterwards.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks at him with an indefinable expression.] And yet you build all
        these nurseries.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Seriously.] Have you never noticed, Hilda, how the impossible&mdash;how
        it seems to beckon and cry aloud to one?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Reflecting.] The impossible? [With animation.] Yes, indeed! Is that how
        you feel too?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, I do.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Then there must be&mdash;a little of the troll in you too.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Why of the troll?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        What would you call it, then?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Rises.] Well, well, perhaps you are right. [Vehemently.] But how can I
        help turning into a troll, when this is how it always goes with me in
        everything&mdash;in everything!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        How do you mean?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Speaking low, with inward emotion.] Mark what I say to you, Hilda. All
        that I have succeeded in doing, building, creating&mdash;all the beauty,
        security, cheerful comfort&mdash;ay, and magnificence too&mdash;[Clenches
        his hands.] Oh, is it not terrible even to think of&mdash;?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        What is so terrible?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        That all this I have to make up for, to pay for&mdash;not in money, but
        in human happiness. And not with my own happiness only, but with other
        people's too. Yes, yes, do you see that, Hilda? That is the price which
        my position as an artist has cost me&mdash;and others. And every single
        day I have to look on while the price is paid for me anew. Over again,
        and over again&mdash;and over again for ever!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Rises and looks steadily at him.] Now I can see that you are thinking
        of&mdash;of her.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, mainly of Aline. For Aline&mdash;she, too, had her vocation in
        life, just as much as I had mine. [His voice quivers.] But her vocation
        has had to be stunted, and crushed, and shattered&mdash;in order that
        mine might force its way to&mdash;to a sort of great victory. For you
        must know that Aline&mdash;she, too, had a talent for building.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        She! For building?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Shakes his head.] Not houses and towers, and spires&mdash;not such
        things as I work away at&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Well, but what then?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Softly, with emotion.] For building up the souls of little children,
        Hilda. For building up children's souls in perfect balance, and in noble
        and beautiful forms. For enabling them to soar up into erect and
        full-grown human souls. That was Aline's talent. And there it all lies
        now&mdash;unused and unusable for ever&mdash;of no earthly service to
        any one&mdash;just like the ruins left by a fire.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, but even if this were so&mdash;?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        It is so! It is so! I know it!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Well, but in any case it is not your fault.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Fixes his eyes on her, and nods slowly.] Ah, that is the great, the
        terrible question. That is the doubt that is gnawing me&mdash;night and
        day.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        That?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes. Suppose the fault was mine&mdash;in a certain sense.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Your fault! The fire!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        All of it; the whole thing. And yet, perhaps&mdash;I may not have had
        anything to do with it.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks at him with a troubled expression.] Oh, Mr. Solness&mdash;if you
        can talk like that, I am afraid you must be&mdash;ill after all.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        H'm&mdash;I don't think I shall ever be of quite sound mind on that
        point.

        Well, well, then I must go home and tell father what you say&mdash;I

      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I had noticed the split in the flue long, long before the fire. Every
        time I went up into the attic, I looked to see if it was still there.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        And it was?

      <p>
        Nothing.
      </p>

        And did not think of repairing the flue either?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh yes, I thought about it&mdash;but never got any further. Every time I
        intended to set to work, it seemed just as if a hand held me back. Not
        to-day, I thought&mdash;to-morrow; and nothing ever came of it.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        But why did you keep putting it off like that?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Because I was revolving something in my mind. [Slowly, and in a low
        voice.] Through that little black crack in the chimney, I might,
        perhaps, force my way upwards&mdash;as a builder.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looking straight in front of her.] That must have been thrilling.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Almost irresistible&mdash;quite irresistible. For at that time it
        appeared to me a perfectly simple and straightforward matter. I would
        have had it happen in the winter-time&mdash;a little before midday. I
        was to be out driving Aline in the sleigh. The servants at home would
        have made huge fires in the stoves.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        For, of course, it was to be bitterly cold that day?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Rather biting, yes&mdash;and they would want Aline to find it thoroughly
        snug and warm when she came home.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I suppose she is very chilly by nature?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        She is. And as we drove home, we were to see the smoke.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Only the smoke?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        The smoke first. But when we came up to the garden gate, the whole of
        the old timber-box was to be a rolling mass of flames.&mdash;That is how
        I wanted it to be, you see.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Oh, why, why could it not have happened so!
      </p>

        You may well say that, Hilda.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Well, but now listen, Mr. Solness. Are you perfectly certain that the
        fire was caused by that little crack in the chimney!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No, on the contrary&mdash;I am perfectly certain that the crack in the
        chimney had nothing whatever to do with the fire.

      HILDA.
      <p>
        What!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.

        It has been clearly ascertained that the fire broke out in a
        clothes-cupboard&mdash;in a totally different part of the house.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Then what is all this nonsense you are talking about the crack in the
        chimney!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        May I go on talking to you a little, Hilda?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, if you'll only talk sensibly&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I will try to. [He moves his chair nearer.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Out with it, then, Mr. Solness.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Confidentially.] Don't you agree with me, Hilda, that there exist
        special, chosen people who have been endowed with the power and faculty
        if desiring a thing, craving for a thing, willing a thing&mdash;so
        persistently and so&mdash;so inexorably&mdash;that at last it has to
        happen? Don't you believe that?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [With an indefinable expression in her eyes.] If that is so, we shall
        see, one of these days, whether <i>I</i> am one of the chosen.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        It is not one's self alone that can do such great things. Oh, no&mdash;the
        helpers and the servers&mdash;they must do their part too, if it is to
        be of any good. But they never come of themselves. One has to call upon
        them very persistently&mdash;inwardly, you understand.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        What are these helpers and servers?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh, we can talk about that some other time. For the present, let us keep
        to this business of the fire.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Don't you think that fire would have happened all the same&mdash;even
        without your wishing for it?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        If the house had been old Knut Brovik's, it would never have burnt down
        so conveniently for him. I am sure of that; for he does not know how to
        call for the helpers&mdash;no, nor for the servers, either. [Rises in
        unrest.] So you see, Hilda&mdash;it is my fault, after all, that the
        lives of the two little boys had to be sacrificed. And do you think it
        is not my fault, too, that Aline has never been the woman she should and
        might have been&mdash;and that she most longed to be?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, but if it is all the work of these helpers and servers&mdash;?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Who called for the helpers and servers? It was I! And they came and
        obeyed my will. [In increasing excitement.] That is what people call
        having the luck on your side; but I must tell you what this sort of luck
        feels like! It feels like a great raw place here on my breast. And the
        helpers and servers keep on flaying pieces of skin off other people in
        order to close my sore!&mdash;But still the sore is not healed&mdash;never,
        never! Oh, if you knew how it can sometimes gnaw and burn!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks attentively at him.] You are ill, Mr. Solness. Very ill, I almost
        think.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Say mad; for that is what you mean.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        No, I don't think there is much amiss with your intellect.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        With what then? Out with it!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I wonder whether you were not sent into the world with a sickly
        conscience.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        A sickly conscience? What devilry is that?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I mean that your conscience is feeble&mdash;too delicately built, as it
        were&mdash;hasn't strength to take a grip of things&mdash;to lift and
        bear what is heavy.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Growls.] H'm! May I ask, then, what sort of a conscience one ought to
        have?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I should like your conscience to be&mdash;to be thoroughly robust.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Indeed? Robust, eh? Is your own conscience robust, may I ask?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, I think it is. I have never noticed that it wasn't.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        It has not been put very severely to the test, I should think.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [With a quivering of the lips.] Oh, it was no such simple matter to
        leave father&mdash;I am so awfully fond of him.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Dear me! for a month or two&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I think I shall never go home again.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Never? Then why did you leave him?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Half-seriously, half-banteringly.] Have you forgotten again that the
        ten year are up?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh nonsense. Was anything wrong at home? Eh?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Quite seriously.] It was this impulse within me that urged and goaded
        me to come&mdash;and lured and drew me on, as well.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Eagerly.] There we have it! There we have it, Hilda! There is the troll
        in you too, as in me. For it's the troll in one, you see&mdash;it is
        that that calls to the powers outside us. And then you must give in&mdash;whether
        you will or no.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I almost think you are right, Mr. Solness.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Walks about the room.] Oh, there are devils innumerable abroad in the
        world, Hilda, that one never sees.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Devils, too?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Stops.] Good devils and bad devils; light-haired devils and
        black-haired devils. If only you could always tell whether it is the
        light or dark ones that have got hold of you! [Paces about.] Ho-ho! Then
        it would be simple enough!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Follows him with her eyes.] Or if one had a really vigorous, radiantly
        healthy conscience&mdash;so that one dared to do what one would.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Stops beside the console table.] I believe, now, that most people are
        just as puny creatures as I am in that respect.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I shouldn't wonder.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Leaning against the table.] In the sagas&mdash;. Have you read any of
        the old sagas?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Oh yes! When I used to read books, I&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        In the sagas you read about vikings, who sailed to foreign lands, and
        plundered and burned and killed men&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        And carried off women&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLNESS. &mdash;and kept them in captivity&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        HILDA. &mdash;took them home in their ships&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLNESS. &mdash;and behaved to them like&mdash;like the very worst of
        trolls.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks straight before her, with a half-veiled look.] I think that must
        have been thrilling.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [With a short, deep laugh.] To carry off women, eh?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        To be carried off.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Looks at her a moment.] Oh, indeed.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [As if breaking the thread of the conversation.] But what made you speak
        of these vikings, Mr. Solness?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Why, those fellows must have had robust consciences, if you like! When
        they got home again, they could eat and drink, and be as happy as
        children. And the women, too! They often would not leave them on any
        account. Can you understand that, Hilda?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Those women I can understand exceedingly well.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oho! Perhaps you could do the same yourself?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Why not?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Live&mdash;of your own free will&mdash;with a ruffian like that?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        If it was a ruffian I had come to love&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Could you come to love a man like that?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Good heavens, you know very well one can't choose whom one is going to
        love.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Looks meditatively at her.] Oh no, I suppose it is the troll within one
        that's responsible for that.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Half-laughing.] And all those blessed devils, that you know so well&mdash;both
        the light-haired and the dark-haired ones.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Quietly and warmly.] Then I hope with all my heart that the devils will
        choose carefully for you, Hilda.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        For me they have chosen already&mdash;once and for all.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Looks earnestly at her.] Hilda&mdash;you are like a wild bird of the
        woods.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Far from it. I don't hide myself away under the bushes.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No, no. There is rather something of the bird of prey in you.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        That is nearer it&mdash;perhaps. [Very vehemently.] And why not a bird
        of prey? Why should not <i>I</i> go a-hunting&mdash;I, as well as the
        rest? Carry off the prey I want&mdash;if only I can get my claws into
        it, and do with it as I will.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Hilda&mdash;do you know what you are?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, I suppose I am a strange sort of bird.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No. You are like a dawning day. When I look at you&mdash;I seem to be
        looking towards the sunrise.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Tell me, Mr. Solness&mdash;are you certain that you have never called me
        to you? Inwardly, you know?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Softly and slowly.] I almost think I must have.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        What did you want with me?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        You are the younger generation, Hilda.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Smiles.] That younger generation that you are so afraid of?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Nods slowly.] And which, in my heart, I yearn towards so deeply.
      </p>

     [HILDA rises, goes to the little table, and fetches RAGNAR
       BROVIK'S portfolio.
</pre>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Holds out the portfolio to him.] We were talking of these drawings&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Shortly, waving them away.] Put those things away! I have seen enough
        of them.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, but you have to write your approval on them.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Write my approval on them? Never!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        But the poor old man is lying at death's door! Can't you give him and
        his son this pleasure before they are parted? And perhaps he might get
        the commission to carry them out, too.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, that is just what he would get. He has made sure of that&mdash;has
        my fine gentleman!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Then, good heavens&mdash;if that is so&mdash;can't you tell the least
        little bit of a lie for once in a way?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        A lie? [Raging.] Hilda&mdash;take those devil's drawings out of my
        sight!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Draws the portfolio a little nearer to herself.] Well, well, well&mdash;don't
        bite me.&mdash;You talk of trolls&mdash;but I think you go on like a
        troll yourself. [Looks round.] Where do you keep your pen and ink?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        There is nothing of the sort in here.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Goes towards the door.] But in the office where that young lady is&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Stay where you are, Hilda!&mdash;I ought to tell a lie, you say. Oh yes,
        for the sake of his old father I might well do that&mdash;for in my time
        I have crushed him, trodden him under foot&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Him, too?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I needed room for myself. But this Ragnar&mdash;he must on no account be
        allowed to come to the front.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Poor fellow, there is surely no fear of that. If he has nothing in him&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Comes closer, looks at her, and whispers.] If Ragnar Brovik gets his
        chance, he will strike me to the earth. Crush me&mdash;as I crushed his
        father.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Crush you? Has he the ability for that?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, you may depend upon it he has the ability! He is the younger
        generation that stands ready to knock at my door&mdash;to make an end of
        Halvard Solness.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks at him with quiet reproach.] And yet you would bar him out. Fie,
        Mr. Solness!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        The fight I have been fighting has cost heart's blood enough.&mdash;And
        I am afraid, too, that the helpers and servers will not obey me any
        longer.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Then you must go ahead without them. There is nothing else for it.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        It is hopeless, Hilda. The luck is bound to turn. A little sooner or a
        little later. Retribution is inexorable.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [In distress, putting her hands over her ears.] Don't talk like that! Do
        you want to kill me? To take from me what is more than my life?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        And what is that?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        The longing to see you great. To see you, with a wreath in your hand,
        high, high up upon a church-tower. [Calm again.] Come, out with your
        pencil now. You must have a pencil about you?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Takes out his pocket-book.] I have one here.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Lays the portfolio on the sofa-table.] Very well. Now let us two sit
        down here, Mr. Solness. [SOLNESS seats himself at the table. HILDA
        stands behind him, leaning over the back of the chair.] And now we well
        write on the drawings. We must write very, very nicely and cordially&mdash;for
        this horrid Ruar&mdash;or whatever his name is.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Writes a few words, turns his head and looks at her.] Tell me one
        thing, Hilda.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        If you have been waiting for me all these ten years&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        What then?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Why have you never written to me? Then I could have answered you.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Hastily.] No, no, no! That was just what I did not want.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Why not?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I was afraid the whole thing might fall to pieces.&mdash;But we were
        going to write on the drawings, Mr. Solness.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        So we were.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Bends forward and looks over his shoulder while he writes.] Mind now,
        kindly and cordially! Oh how I hate&mdash;how I hate this Ruald&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Writing.] Have you never really cared for any one, Hilda?

        For any one else, I suppose you mean?

        [Looks up at her.] For any one else, yes. Have you never? In all these
        ten years? Never?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Oh yes, now and then. When I was perfectly furious with you for not
        coming.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Then you did take an interest in other people, too?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        A little bit&mdash;for a week or so. Good heavens, Mr. Solness, you
        surely know how such things come about.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Hilda&mdash;what is it you have come for?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Don't waste time talking. The poor old man might go and die in the
        meantime.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Answer me, Hilda. What do you want of me?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I want my kingdom.

  He gives a rapid glance toward the door on the left, and
  then goes on writing on the drawings.  At the same moment
  MRS. SOLNESS enters.
</pre>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Here are a few things I have got for you, Miss Wangel. The large parcels
        will be sent later on.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Oh, how very, very kind of you!

      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Only my simple duty. Nothing more than that.

        Yes?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.

        Did you notice whether the&mdash;the book-keeper was out there?
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, of course, she was there.

      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        She was standing at the desk, as she always is&mdash;when <i>I</i> go
        through the room.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Rises.] Then I'll give this to her and tell her that&mdash;

      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Takes the portfolio from him.] Oh, no, let me have the pleasure of
        doing that! [Goes to the door, but turns.] What is her name?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Her name is Miss Fosli.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Pooh, that sounds so cold! Her Christian name, I mean?

        Yes, do. Now Ragnar will have a chance of building for himself.

        You will have other things to think of now, and to attend to; and that
        is a very good thing for you. Well, go home with the drawings now, Miss
        Fosli. At once! Do you hear?

      KAIA.

        Was not that what you wished?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        But how can you get on without her&mdash;? Oh well, no doubt you have
        some one else in reserve, Halvard.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Playfully.] Well, <i>I</i> for one am not the person to stand at a
        desk.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Never mind, never mind&mdash;it will be all right, Aline. Now all you
        have to do is think about moving into our new home&mdash;as quickly as
        you can. This evening we will hang up the wreath&mdash;[Turns to HILDA.]
        What do you say to that, Miss Hilda?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks at him with sparkling eyes.] It will be splendid to see you so
        high up once more.

      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Me!
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.

        For Heaven's sake, Miss Wangel, don't imagine such a thing! My husband!&mdash;when
        he always gets so dizzy!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        He get dizzy! No, I know quite well he does not!
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh yes, indeed he does.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        But I have seen him with my own eyes right up at the top of a high
        church-tower!
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, I hear people talk of that; but it is utterly impossible&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Vehemently.] Impossible&mdash;impossible, yes! But there I stood all
        the same!
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        O, how can you say so, Halvard? Why, you can't even bear to go out on
        the second-storey balcony here. You have always been like that.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        You may perhaps see something different this evening.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [In alarm.] No, no, no! Please God I shall never see that. I will write
        at once to the doctor&mdash;and I am sure he won't let you do it.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Why, Aline&mdash;!
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.

        That I turn dizzy?
      </p>
      HILDA.

        Yes.

      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Approaches her.] You might have the topmost room in the tower, Hilda&mdash;there

        [Indefinably, between earnest and jest.] Yes, that is what you promised
        me.

      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Did I really?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Fie, Mr. Solness! You said I should be a princess, and that you would
        give me a kingdom. And then you went and&mdash;Well!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Cautiously.] Are you quite certain that this is not a dream&mdash;a
        fancy, that has fixed itself in your mind?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Sharply.] Do you mean that you did not do it?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I scarcely know myself. [More softly.] But now I know so much for
        certain, that I&mdash;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The large broad verandah of SOLNESS'S dwelling-house.  Part
  of the house, with outer door leading to the verandah, is
  seen to the left.  A railing along the verandah to the right.
  At the back, from the end of the verandah, a flight of steps
  leads down to the garden below.  Tall old trees in the
  garden spread their branches over the verandah and towards
  the house.  Far to the right, in among the trees, a glimpse
  is caught of the lower part of the new villa, with scaffolding
  round so much as is seen of the tower.  In the background
  the garden is bounded by an old wooden fence.  Outside the
  fence, a street with low, tumble-down cottages.

  Evening sky with sun-lit clouds.

  On the verandah, a garden bench stands along the wall of the
  house, and in front of the bench a long table.  On the other
  side of the table, an arm-chair and some stools.  All the
  furniture is of wicker-work.

  MRS. SOLNESS, wrapped in a large white crepe shawl, sits
  resting in the arm-chair and gazes over to the right.
  Shortly after, HILDA WANGEL comes up the flight of steps
  from the garden.  She is dressed as in the last act, and
  wears her hat.  She has in her bodice a little nosegay of
  small common flowers.
</pre>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Turning her head a little.] Have you been round the garden, Miss
        Wangel?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, I have been taking a look at it.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        And found some flowers too, I see.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, indeed! There are such heaps of them in among the bushes.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Are there, really? Still? You see I scarcely ever go there.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Closer.] What! Don't you take a run down into the garden every day,
        then?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [With a faint smile.] I don't "run" anywhere, nowadays.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Well, but do you not go down now and then to look at all the lovely
        things there?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        It has all become so strange to me. I am almost afraid to see it again.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Your own garden!
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I don't feel that it is mine any longer.

        What do you mean&mdash;?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        No, no, it is not&mdash;not as it was in my mother's and father's time.
        They have taken away so much&mdash;so much of the garden, Miss Wangel.
        Fancy&mdash;they have parcelled it out&mdash;and built houses for
        strangers&mdash;people that I don't know. And they can sit and look in
        upon me from their windows.
      </p>
      HILDA.

        over to the new house?

      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, yes, Miss Wangel; for it is only my duty to submit myself to him.
        But very often it is dreadfully difficult to force one's mind to
        obedience.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, that must be difficult indeed.

        [With a sigh.] Yes, everything that was mine was burnt.

      <p>
        Oh, yes, the boys. But, you see, that was a thing apart. That was a

        No, no, I think that is only natural.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        And often and often I have to remind myself that it was a righteous
        punishment for me&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Why?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Because I had not fortitude enough in misfortune.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        But I don't see that&mdash;
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh, no, no, Miss Wangel&mdash;do not talk to me any more about the two
        little boys. We ought to feel nothing but joy in thinking of them; for
        they are so happy&mdash;so happy now. No, it is the small losses in life
        that cut one to the heart&mdash;the loss of all that other people look
        upon as almost nothing.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Lays her arms on MRS. SOLNESS'S knees, and looks up at her
        affectionately.] Dear Mrs. Solness&mdash;tell me what things you mean!
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        As I say, only little things. All the old portraits were burnt on the
        walls. And all the old silk dresses were burnt, what had belonged to the
        family for generations and generations. And all mother's and
        grandmother's lace&mdash;that was burnt, too. And only think&mdash;the
        jewels, too! [Sadly.] And then all the dolls.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        The dolls?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Choking with tears.] I had nine lovely dolls.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        And they were burnt too?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        All of them. Oh, it was hard&mdash;so hard for me.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Had you put by all these dolls, then? Ever since you were little?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I had not put them by. The dolls and I had gone on living together.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        After you were grown up?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, long after that.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        After you were married, too?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh yes, indeed. So long as he did not see it&mdash;. But they were all
        burnt up, poor things. No one thought of saving them. Oh, it is so
        miserable to think of. You mustn't laugh at me, Miss Wangel.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I am not laughing in the least.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        For you see, in a certain sense, there was life in them, too. I carried
        them under my heart&mdash;like little unborn children.

  DR. HERDAL, with his hat in his hand, comes out through the

      <p>
        Yes, yes. But is there anything going on here? I got a note from you.

      <p>
        [Rises.] Yes, there is something I must talk to you about.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Very well; then perhaps we better go in. [To HILDA.] Still in your
        mountaineering dress, Miss Wangel?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Gaily, rising.] Yes&mdash;in full uniform! But to-day I am not going
        climbing and breaking my neck. We two will stop quietly below and look
        on, doctor.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        What are we to look on at?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Softly, in alarm, to HILDA.] Hush, hush&mdash;for God's sake! He is
        coming! Try to get that idea out of his head. And let us be friends,
        Miss Wangel. Don't you think we can?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>

        could!
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Gently disengages herself.] There, there, there! There he comes,
        doctor. Let me have a word with you.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Is it about him?
      </p>

        Yes, to be sure it's about him. Do come in.

      HILDA.
      <p>
        I have noticed that as soon as you come, you make her go.

      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Perhaps so. But I cannot help it. [Looks observantly at her.] Are you
        cold, Hilda? I think you look cold.

        I caught sight of you from over there.

        I knew she would go at once if I came.

      <p>
        In one sense, it's a relief as well.
      </p>

        loveliest thing in the world&mdash;that we two are to build together?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Is silent a little while, then says with an indefinable expression in
        her eyes.] Castles in the air.

      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Castles in the air?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Nods.] Castles in the air, yes! Do you know what sort of thing a castle
        in the air is?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        It is the loveliest thing in the world, you say.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Rises with vehemence, and makes a gesture of repulsion with her hand.]
        Yes, to be sure it is! Castles in the air&mdash;they are so easy to
        build, too&mdash;[looks scornfully at him]&mdash;especially for the
        builders who have a&mdash;a dizzy conscience.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Rises.] After this day we two will build together, Hilda.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [With a half-dubious smile.] A real castle in the air?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes. One with a firm foundation under it.

  RAGNAR BROVIK comes out from the house.  He is carrying a
  large green wreath with flowers and silk ribbons.

      HILDA.

        [With an outburst of pleasure.] The wreath! Oh, that will be glorious!

        No.

      SOLNESS.

        Was he not cheered by what I wrote?

        It came too late.

      SOLNESS.

        Too late!
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        When she came with it he was unconscious. He had had a stroke.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Why, then, you must go home to him! You must attend to your father!
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        He does not need me any more.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.

        But surely you ought to be with him.

      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I will take it down to them myself [Takes the wreath from him.] And now
        you go home; we don't require you to-day.

      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        I know you do not require me any more; but to-day I shall remain.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Well, remain then, since you are bent upon it.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [At the railing.] Mr. Solness, I will stand here and look on at you.

      SOLNESS.

        At me!
      </p>
      HILDA.

        It will be fearfully thrilling.

        He! Oh yes, I am likely to believe that!
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        In a certain sense he is cowardly&mdash;he, the great master builder. He
        is not afraid of robbing others of their happiness&mdash;as he has done
        both for my father and me. But when it comes to climbing up a paltry bit
        of scaffolding&mdash;he will do anything rather than that.

      HILDA.

        Oh, you should just have seen him high, high up&mdash;at the dizzy
        height where I once saw him.

      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        Did you see that?
      </p>
      HILDA.

        Yes, indeed I did. How free and great he looked as he stood and fastened
        the wreath to the church vane!
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        I know that he ventured that, once in his life&mdash;one solitary time.
        It is a legend among us younger men. But no power on earth would induce
        him to do it again.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        To-day he will do it again!
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        [Scornfully.] Yes, I daresay!
      </p>
      HILDA.

      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Scornfully.] He pleased with me! How can you talk so, Hilda? He who
        gave the troll in me leave to lord it just as it pleased. He who bade
        them be at hand to serve me, both day and might&mdash;all these&mdash;all
        these&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Devils&mdash;
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, of both kinds. Oh no, he made me feel clearly enough that he was
        not pleased with me. [Mysteriously.] You see, that was really the reason
        why he made the old house burn down.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Was that why?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, don't you understand? He wanted to give me the chance of becoming
        an accomplished master in my own sphere&mdash;so that I might build all
        the more glorious churches for him. At first I did not understand what
        he was driving at; but all of a sudden it flashed upon me.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        When was that?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        It was when I was building the church-tower up at Lysanger.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I thought so.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        For you see, Hilda&mdash;up there, amidst those new surroundings, I used
        to go about musing and pondering within myself. Then I saw plainly why
        he had taken my little children from me. It was that I should have
        nothing else to attach myself to. No such thing as love and happiness,
        you understand. I was to be only a master builder&mdash;nothing else,
        and all my life long I was to go on building for him. [Laughs.] But I
        can tell you nothing came of that!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        What did you do then?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        First of all, I searched and tried my own heart&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        And then?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        The I did the impossible&mdash;I, no less than he.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        The impossible?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I had never before been able to climb up to a great, free height. But
        that day I did it.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Leaping up.] Yes, yes, you did!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        And when I stood there, high over everything, and was hanging the wreath
        over the vane, I said to him: Hear me now, thou Mighty One! From this
        day forward I will be a free builder&mdash;I too, in my sphere&mdash;just
        as thou in thine. I will never more build churches for thee&mdash;only
        homes for human beings.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [With great sparkling eyes.] That was the song that I heard through the
        air!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        But afterwards his turn came.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        What do you mean by that?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Looks despondently at her.] Building homes for human beings&mdash;is
        not worth a rap, Hilda.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Do you say that now?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, for now I see it. Men have no use for these homes of theirs&mdash;to
        be happy in. And I should not have had any use for such a home, if I had
        had one. [With a quiet, bitter laugh.] See, that is the upshot of the
        whole affair, however far back I look. Nothing really built; nor
        anything sacrificed for the chance of building. Nothing, nothing! the
        whole is nothing!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Then you will never build anything more?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [With animation.] On the contrary, I am just going to begin!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        What, then? What will you build? Tell me at once!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I believe there is only one possible dwelling-place for human happiness&mdash;and
        that is what I am going to build now.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Looks fixedly at him.] Mr. Solness&mdash;you mean our castles in the
        air.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        The castles in the air&mdash;yes.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        I am afraid you would turn dizzy before we got half-way up.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Not if I can mount hand in hand with you, Hilda.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [With an expression of suppressed resentment.] Only with me? Will there
        be no others of the party?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Who else should there be?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Oh&mdash;that girl&mdash;that Kaia at the desk. Poor thing&mdash;don't
        you want to take her with you too?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oho! Was it about her that Aline was talking to you?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Is it so&mdash;or is it not?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Vehemently.] I will not answer such a question. You must believe in me,
        wholly and entirely!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        All these ten years I have believed in you so utterly&mdash;so utterly.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        You must go on believing in me!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Then let me see you stand free and high up!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Sadly.] Oh Hilda&mdash;it is not every day that I can do that.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Passionately.] I will have you do it! I will have it! [Imploringly.]
        Just once more, Mr. Solness! Do the impossible once again!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Stands and looks deep into her eyes.] If I try it, Hilda, I will stand
        up there and talk to him as I did that time before.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [In rising excitement.] What will you say to him?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        I will say to him: Hear me, Mighty Lord&mdash;thou may'st judge me as
        seems best to thee. But hereafter I will build nothing but the loveliest
        thing in the world&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Carried away.] Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes!
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLNESS. &mdash;build it together with a princess, whom I love&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, tell him that! Tell him that!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes. And then I will say to him: Now I shall go down and throw my arms
        round her and kiss her&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        HILDA. &mdash;many times! Say that!
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLNESS. &mdash;many, many times, I will say it!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        And then&mdash;?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Then I will wave my hat&mdash;and come down to the earth&mdash;and do as
        I said to him.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [With outstretched arms.] Now I see you again as I did when there was
        song in the air!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Looks at here with his head bowed.] How have you become what you are,
        Hilda?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        How have you made me what I am?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Shortly and firmly.] The princess shall have her castle.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Jubilant, clapping her hands.] Oh, Mr. Solness&mdash;! My lovely,
        lovely castle. Our castle in the air!
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        On a firm foundation.
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [In the street a crowd of people has assembled, vaguely seen
       through the trees.  Music of wind-instruments is heard far
       away behind the new house.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  MRS. SOLNESS, with a fur collar round her neck, DOCTOR HERDAL
  with her white shawl on his arm, and some ladies, come out
  on the verandah.  RAGNAR BROVIK comes at the same time up
  from the garden.
</pre>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [To RAGNAR.] Are we to have music, too?
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        Yes. It's the band of the Mason's Union. [To SOLNESS.] The foreman asked
        me to tell you that he is ready now to go up with the wreath.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Takes his hat.] Good. I will go down to him myself.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Anxiously.] What have you to do down there, Halvard?
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Curtly.] I must be down below with the men.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Yes, down below&mdash;only down below.
      </p>
      SOLNESS.
      <p>
        That is where I always stand&mdash;on everyday occasions.
      </p>

     [He goes down the flight of steps and away through the garden.
</pre>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Calls after him over the railing.] But do beg the man to be careful
        when he goes up! Promise me that, Halvard!
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        [To MRS. SOLNESS.] Don't you see that I was right? He has given up all
        thought of that folly.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh, what a relief! Twice workmen have fallen, and each time they were
        killed on the spot. [Turns to HILDA.] Thank you, Miss Wangel, for having
        kept such a firm hold upon him. I should never have been able to manage
        him.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        [Playfully.] Yes, yes, Miss Wangel, you know how to keep firm hold on a
        man, when you give your mind to it.
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [MRS. SOLNESS and DR. HERDAL go up to the ladies, who are
       standing nearer to the steps and looking over the garden.
       HILDA remains standing beside the railing in the foreground.
       RAGNAR goes up to her.
</pre>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        [With suppressed laughter, half whispering.] Miss Wangel&mdash;do you
        see all those young fellows down in the street?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes.
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        They are my fellow students, come to look at the master.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        What do they want to look at him for?
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        They want to see how he daren't climb to the top of his own house.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        Oh, that is what those boys want, is it?
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        [Spitefully and scornfully.] He has kept us down so long&mdash;now we
        are going to see him keep quietly down below himself.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        You will not see that&mdash;not this time.
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        [Smiles.] Indeed! Then where shall we see him?
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        High&mdash;high up by the vane! That is where you will see him!
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        [Laughs.] Him! Oh yes, I daresay!
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        His will is to reach the top&mdash;so at the top you shall see him.
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        His will, yes; that I can easily believe. But he simply cannot do it.
        His head would swim round, long, long before he got half-way. He would
        have to crawl down again on his hands and knees.
      </p>
      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        [Points across.] Look! There goes the foreman up the ladders.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        And of course he has the wreath to carry too. Oh, I do hope he will be
        careful!
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        [Stares incredulously and shouts.] Why, but it's&mdash;
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        [Breaking out in jubilation.] It is the master builder himself?
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Screams with terror.] Yes, it is Halvard! Oh my great God&mdash;!
        Halvard! Halvard!

      <p>
        Hush! Don't shout to him!

      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        [Half beside herself.] I must go to him! I must get him to come down
        again!

      HILDA.
      <p>

        and higher! Higher and higher! Look! Just look!
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        [Breathless.] He must turn now. He can't possibly help it.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        He climbs and climbs. He will soon be at the top now.
      </p>
      MRS. SOLNESS.
      <p>
        Oh, I shall die of terror. I cannot bear to see it.

      DR. HERDAL.
      <p>
        Then don't look up at him.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        There he is standing on the topmost planks! Right at the top!

        Nobody must move! Do you dear?
      </p>

        Frightfully thrilling all the same. Look at him! Now he is hanging the
        wreath round the vane!

      RAGNAR.

      HILDA.
      <p>
        Yes, it is the impossible that he is doing now! [With the indefinable
        expression in her eyes.] Can you see any one else up there with him?

      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        There is no one else.

        You are mistaken.

        Then do you hear no song in the air, either?
      </p>
      RAGNAR.
      <p>
        It must be the wind in the tree-tops.
      </p>
      HILDA.
      <p>
        <i>I</i> hear a song&mdash;a mighty song! [Shouts in wild jubilation and
        glee.] Look, look! Now he is waving his hat! He is waving it to us down
        here! Oh, wave, wave back to him! For now it is finished! [Snatches the
        white shawl from the Doctor, waves it, and shouts up to SOLNESS.] Hurrah
        for Master Builder Solness!
      </p>

       the shouts of "Hurrah" are taken up in the street.  Then they

       is vaguely perceived crashing down behind the trees.

       pause.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
